# Landmark-Remark
A simple iOS appto let the users save landmarks at their current locations and add note to that. Users can search for landmarks created by them and also by other users.

The explicit requirements are:  
1.	As a user (of the application) I can see my current location on a map  
2.	As a user I can save a short note at my current location  
3.	As a user I can see notes that I have saved at the location they were saved on the map  
4.	As a user I can see the location, text, and user­name of notes other users have saved  
5.	As a user I have the ability to search for a note based on contained text or user­name
